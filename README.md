# SproutAI
## 🌱 Inspiration
As a 17-year-old student passionate about technology and STEM education, I wanted to create something that could **spark curiosity in young learners**. Spring symbolizes growth and new beginnings — the perfect theme to encourage kids to explore STEM concepts in a fun and engaging way. With limited coding experience, I saw this as a personal challenge to build a working product that also contributes to **social good**.

## 🤖 What it does
**SproutAI** is a **spring-themed educational chatbot** designed to help learners explore **STEM topics** in a friendly, conversational way. Built with **Streamlit**, it includes:
- A playful chatbot persona that answers questions related to STEM and spring 🌼  
- A multiple-choice quiz mode to test your knowledge  
- A user-friendly, interactive web interface with no login required  

It’s designed to make STEM learning more accessible, enjoyable, and seasonally themed.

## 🔧 How we built it
- **Python** was used for the backend logic.
- The app was created using **Streamlit**, a lightweight Python framework for web apps.
- To make it beginner-friendly, we used **local logic-based chatbot behavior** instead of paid APIs.
- The UI includes a chatbot interface, quiz toggle, and prompt response formatting.
- Assets like the **SproutAI logo and illustrations** were created with AI tools to enhance the user experience.

---

## 🧱 Challenges we ran into
- Learning Streamlit from scratch as a beginner
- Integrating OpenAI API initially caused quota errors, so we pivoted to a logic-based model
- File errors like `.txt` instead of `.py`, Python path issues, and version mismatches
- Understanding how to run and deploy a Streamlit app without prior experience

---

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully built a functioning chatbot app as a solo beginner in under 48 hours
- Designed a clean user interface with interactive elements
- Learned Python package management, GitHub usage, and the basics of UI/UX
- Adapted and debugged multiple challenges independently

---

## 📚 What we learned
- How to use **Streamlit** to build Python web apps
- How chatbots work and how to simulate conversational logic
- The importance of clean UI and user interaction
- Basic version control and code structuring with GitHub
- Troubleshooting real-world developer issues (APIs, environments, CLI tools)

---

## 🌱 What's next for SproutAI
- Add **real AI integration** using OpenAI API or Gemini (once quota allows)
- Expand the quiz section with score tracking and more questions
- Add **voice input and speech output** for accessibility
- Host it online using **Streamlit Community Cloud**
- Translate chatbot responses into different languages for global accessibility
- Partner with schools to promote the app during science weeks or spring camps

SproutAI started as a beginner’s experiment, but it’s grown into a meaningful project that shows how tech can make education **playful, seasonal, and impactful** 🌸
